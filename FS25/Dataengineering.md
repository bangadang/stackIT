# Dataengineering 

## Lessons Learned
|Date| Sumamary |
|--|--|
| 20.02.25 | Data engineering is an essential step in order to train models (Big Data) |
| |5V of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value)  |
| |Challenges (heterogenity, inconsistency/-completeness/ scaleability, timeliness, data ownership) |
| |intro to pandas |
| 27.02.25 | reasons for data quality issues : a lot of different data sources, data can be falsely measured, extracted or entered etc., variety of formats (export errors) |
|  | to avoid issues: domain knowledge, clean data |
|  | RegEx Intro: match, extract, find, replace with patterns |
|06.03.25  | Reminder Relations and comparison to nested datastructres like json |
|  | Data Processing |
|  | Record Linkage: Ausgangslage: Wie findet man Duplikate in einem oder verschiedenen Datasets ohne key?[andere common names:fuzzy match, entitty resolution, entitity clustering usw.] --> create join condition which is not too specific, too inclusive but matches approximating |
|  | levensthein distance: the minimum number of character edit operations needed to turn one string into the other. 
||- copy character from s to t (cost = 0) - delete a character from s (cost = 1) 
||- insert a character into t (cost = 1) 
||- substitute one character for another (cost = 1)|
| 13.03.25 | **advantages of storing data in relational systems**: |
|  | interfaces are well defined, data is well organized and structured |
|  | schema provide meta-data |
|  | synchronized multi-user support |
|  | query processing engines do efficient preprocessing and deliver data as wanted/needed |
|  | **disadvantages**: |
|  | only scales to mediuim sized datasets |
|  | limited functions for analytics |
|  | problems occur for semi-/unstructured data |
|  | **data warehousing** |
|  | Definition: a data warehouse is a collection of data in support of managementâ€™s decision-making process |
|  | stores **subject-oriented** information rather than processes (subjects like product, customer, sales etc.) |
|  | **integrates** data from heterogenous sources |
|  | **time-variant**: stored data is associatted with a time period, provides information from the historical point of view |
|  | **non-volatile**: a data warehouse is kept separate from the operational database and new added data does not erase old data |
|  | data warehouses support business executives to organize, analyze, and use their data for decision making |
|  | data warehouses are commonly used in: financial/ banking services, consumer goods, retail sector, controlled manufacturing |
|  | types of data warehouses: |
