## Lessons Learned
|Date| Sumamary |

| 20.02.25 | Data engineering is an essential step in order to train models (Big Data) |
| |5V of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value)  |
| |Challenges (heterogenity, inconsistency/-completeness/ scaleability, timeliness, data ownership) |
| |intro to pandas |
| 27.02.25 | reasons for data quality issues : a lot of different data sources, data can be falsely measured, extracted or entered etc., variety of formats (export errors) |
|  | to avoid issues: domain knowledge, clean data |
|  | RegEx Intro: match, extract, find, replace with patterns |
|06.03.25  | Reminder Relations and comparison to nested datastructres like json |
|  | Data Processing |
|  | Record Linkage: Ausgangslage: Wie findet man Duplikate in einem oder verschiedenen Datasets ohne key?[andere common names:fuzzy match, entitty resolution, entitity clustering usw.] --> create join condition which is not too specific, too inclusive but matches approximating |
|  | levensthein distance: the minimum number of character edit operations needed to turn one string into the other. 
||- copy character from s to t (cost = 0) - delete a character from s (cost = 1) 
||- insert a character into t (cost = 1) 
||- substitute one character for another (cost = 1)|
| 13.03.25 | **advantages of storing data in relational systems**: |
|  | interfaces are well defined, data is well organized and structured |
|  | schema provide meta-data |
|  | synchronized multi-user support |
|  | query processing engines do efficient preprocessing and deliver data as wanted/needed |
|  | **disadvantages**: |
|  | only scales to mediuim sized datasets |
|  | limited functions for analytics |
|  | problems occur for semi-/unstructured data |
|  | **data warehousing** |
|  | Definition: a data warehouse is a collection of data in support of management’s decision-making process |
|  | stores **subject-oriented** information rather than processes (subjects like product, customer, sales etc.) |
|  | **integrates** data from heterogenous sources |
|  | **time-variant**: stored data is associatted with a time period, provides information from the historical point of view |
|  | **non-volatile**: a data warehouse is kept separate from the operational database and new added data does not erase old data |
|  | data warehouses support business executives to organize, analyze, and use their data for decision making |
|  | data warehouses are commonly used in: financial/ banking services, consumer goods, retail sector, controlled manufacturing |
|  | types of data warehouses: |
|  | **information processing**: DW allow to process data stored within by means of querying, simple statistical analysis, table, charts, graphs |
|  | **analytical processing**: data can be processedd by means of basic OLAP operations including slice-and-dice, drill down/up, pivoting |
|  | **data mining**: knowledge discovery by finding patterns and associations, performing classification and prediction through construced analytical models |
|  | Differences between operational DB and DW |
|  | DW architecture |
|  | Data Marts |
|  | ETL from source to staging area |
|  |  |

### Operational Database vs Data Warehouse
|OLTP| OLAP |

| focus on data in | focus on information out |
| based on Entity Relationship Model | based on Star Schema or Snowflake Schema |
| provides, primitive/ highly detailed/ flat relational view of data | provides summarized/ consolidated/ multidimensional view of data  |
| thousand of active users on the system | hundreds of users on the system |

|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--| --|--|--|
|  | *Staging Area* | *Data Universe* | *Data Universe* | *Data Marts* | *Analysis Services* | *Presentation* | *Front End* |
|  | Structure the data in some form like a file, a database, XML or thelike |  | Applications: Aggregation, Calculations, Event detection, Reusable Entities | Selection, Aggregation, Calculation | Reporting OLAP Mining | Web/App Servers | GUI|
| product data from different origins, like Singapore, New York and Zürich  | Each source is being structured in the same format like a relation/ database | integrate separate relations into a new dimension combining thee different sources |  |  |


### Data Marts
- is a data model, which is ptimised for fast and efficient queries
- does domain specific operations
- presents views of the whole data warehouse
- provides interfaces for analyzing and data mining tasks

## ETL (extract, transform, load)
most time consuming part od data warehousing, as there is no standard method or system but an abundance of different tools
 it it time intense because:
 - different data sources with heterogeneity
 - imense data volume
 - the integration is complex, because of data cleaning and creating a schema and instance integration
 - There are two types of ETL
	 - **batch processing**: data is processed in batches o defines size or time values and requires space for buffering
	 - **real time processing**: data is processeed item by item continuously. Every item can only be seen once.
 
 ### extract
 -  data is collected from one or several sources and held in temporary storage
 - validation test are run on the data to ensure it conforms with its destinations requirements
 - its a task done regularly in order to supply updated data to da data warehouse
 - the data extracted is differentiable through a time setting and defined type of extracted data
	 - **time setting**:
		 - synchronous notification:
			 - upon an update occurence at source the ddata extracton is triggered
		 - asynchronous notification:
			 - periodic: the sources generates an extraction on a regular basis or the DW extracts the updated data on a regular basis
			 - event-driven: the DW extracts the updates at the end of a year or the sources notifies upon each X updates
			 - query-driven: DW checks for new updates before accessing the data
		 - **type of data**:
			 - snapshots: the source delivers the complete dataset each time, like new pricing list or product catalog
				 - requires an update detection and capturing of the update history
			 - logs: the ource logs each update operation on the data through transaction/appplication-driven logging
				 - requires efficient update execution
			 - netlogs: the source delivers net updates though catalog updates, snapshot deltas
				 - source cannot offer a complete history but updating can be done efficiently
### transform
- the data is then processed. So its structures and values conform with its intended use case
	- problem:
		- data is not in the target format of the DW or structured differently. Either the schema is close to thee source or the DW has a multidimensional schema --> data and schema heterogeneity
		- aspects of the transformation: data and schema has to be transformed
	- **heterogeinity**:
		- primary (OLTP systems) and secondary sources provide either un-/semistructured data
		- various data models which require mapping
		- same reality is modeled differently (design autonomy, subjective modeling perspectives)
### load 
- moves the transformed data into a permanent target database efficiently
	- critical point:
		- load routines can block the entire DB
		- active triggers have to be managed
		- integrity constraints have to be upheld
		- Indicies have to be maintained
		- update and inseration operations 
	- **record basedd laoding**:
		- uses standard interfaces
		- triggers, indices ad constraints can remain active all the time
		- no longlasting locks
	- **bulk loading**: standard of irl practice
		- reuires DB specific extensions for loading large volumes
		- runs in special context and loads complete tables or DB blocks
		- ignores triggers and contraints
		- indices are updated upon completion
		- requires checkpoints for resuming
