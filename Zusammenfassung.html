<h1 id="basics-of-data-products-and-services">Basics of Data Products and Services</h1>
<h2 id="definition-of-services">Definition of Services</h2>
<p><strong>macroeconomic view of services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>primary sector: agriculture</li>
<li>secondary sector: manufacturing</li>
<li>tertiary sector: services (in CH growing sector since 1800, main sector today)
<ul>

<h2 id="value-of-data-analytics-today">Value of data &amp; analytics today</h2>
<p>Most large companies have data-driven business models. Good data accquisition and analyzation of data provide a huge value.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-data-product-thinking">Importance of data product thinking</h2>
<p>Top Big Data challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determing how to get value from big data</li>
<li>Defining strategy</li>
<li>Obtaining skills and capabillities necessary</li>
<li>Integratting multiple data soources</li>
<li>Infrastructure and/or architecture</li>
<li>Security, privacy and data quality risks and issues</li>
<li>funding</li>
<li>understanding of big data</li>
<li>leadership / organizational issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Data product concepts provided reliably added value, therefore a data product:</p>
<ol>
<li>generates a customer benefit or satisfies customer needs</li>
<li>is relevant for more than one user</li>
<li>goes through a production process and is produced with quality</li>
<li>is managed within a product life cycle</li>
<li>is a combination of data assets, data related capabillities that together form/contribute to value added prooduct offerings</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data-assets">Data assets</h3>
<p>They belong to a multitude of different data types, like</p>
<ul>
<li>transactional data</li>
<li>demographic data</li>
<li>time series data</li>
<li>location data</li>
<li>IoT Data</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-capabillities">Data capabillities</h3>
<p>They span a wide variety of areas.</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/dataCapabillities.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="data related capabillities" /></p>
<h3 id="value-added-product-offerings">value-added product offerings</h3>
<p>There are four mechanisms of how data and analytics provide value.</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/productOfferings.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="data offerings" /></p>
<p>Prescriptive Analytics translate trends/prediction into actions.</p>
<h2 id="three-types-of-data-products">Three types of data products</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data as a service</strong>
<ul>
<li>This product does not exists without the data it is its , since together with the analytics it generates sales.</li>
<li>Swiss Post Adress Management service</li>
<li>MS Azure Computer Vision service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data-enhanced products</strong>
<ul>
<li>Extends an existing business model by increasing the value of another product (new customer value proposition new revenue streams).</li>
<li>Tesla Auto Pilot</li>
<li>Bosch Predicitve Maintenance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data as insights</strong>
<ul>
<li>Supports business model to improve internal processes for example. It benefits decision making for product innovation and management.</li>
<li>Manufacturing-Analytics</li>
<li>Supply Chain-Analytics</li>
<li>Marketing-Analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>data understanding is often forgotten but a very important step</p>
<p><strong>Generic Tasks and Outputs of the phases</strong></p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/crispTasks.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="CRISP-DM" /></p>
<p>(don't need to memorize the outputs for the exam. only understanding on the high level is needed)</p>
<h1 id="waiting-queues">Waiting Queues</h1>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Waiting at a counter</li>
<li>Waiting for the machine to become free</li>
<li>Waiting for vacant call center employees</li>
<li>Waiting for a free doctor</li>
<li>Waiting for a green light</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>How long do I have to wait?</li>
<li>How long will I be &quot;in the system&quot;?</li>
<li>How likely is it that I won't have to wait?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capacity-managment">Capacity Managment</h2>
<p>Most services fullfill IHIP properties</p>
<ul>
<li>Intangible: Services are no physical object, they are experienced</li>
<li>Heterogeneous: customer involement</li>
<li>Instantaneous:</li>
<li>Perishable:</li>
</ul>
<p>--&gt; Operations managers are concerned with ensuring that the service process has <strong>sufﬁcient resources</strong> to deal with the anticipated levels of <strong>customer demand</strong> in such a way that <strong>quality of service</strong> meets pre-set targets in the most **cost-effective ** manner.</p>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low capacity</strong>: steady caapcity and deal with the consequences of customer insatisfaction and service quality</li>
<li><strong>Chase capacity</strong>: capacity matches predicted demand</li>
<li><strong>Demand management</strong>: influence/ notch cusstomers to prefer non peak times</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="queue-design">Queue design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple lines, multiple servers</li>
<li>single line, multiple servers</li>

<li>To what extent of his time is the postal employee busy serving customers?
22/30 = 73.3%</li>
<li>What is the probability that the post office is empty?
P<sub>0</sub> = (22/30)<sup>0</sup> (1 - 22/30) = 26.7%
<ol type="a">
<li>What is the probability that the queue in the post office is empty?

<h1 id="demand-management-yield-management-price-optimization">Demand management (= Yield management, Price optimization)</h1>
<p>Revenue Management embraces techniques to allocate limited resources to different types of
customers at different prices in order to maximize company revenues.
-&gt; Smooth the load on resources by influencing the demand.</p>
<p>Revenue managment is most effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>product can be sold in advance because it has a limited shelf life</li>
<li>limited product capacity and increasing capacity takes a lot of effort</li>
<li>market/customer can be divided into segments</li>
<li>low variable cost, flying with full or empty plane is roughly the same</li>
<li>fluctuating demand, demand is not known at time of decision</li>
<li>adjustable pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenue management is used in airlines, hotels, car rentals, freight but also in energy, broadcasting, health services, golf, clothing industry.</p>
<h3 id="case-example-american-airlines">Case example American airlines</h3>
<ul>
<li>They need to sell the right payces to the right customers at the right price.</li>
<li>The value of a seat varies depending on demand. (seat hortage&lt;-&gt;high prices, as soon as plane takes off seats are worthless)</li>
<li>Strategy has to consider millions of bookings, cacellation and corrections. Business model needs to divide problems into overbooking, dsicounts, data-traffic management
Proof their strategy works: trillion in revenue and other airline applied their revenue Management</li>

<h1 id="booking-control">Booking Control</h1>
<p>There are two approaches, they have a interrealationship:
<img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/bookingcontrol.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="demand function" />
When using booking and protection limits the same request are accepted or rejected.Depending on the situation one of them is easier to handle.
It is nested because theoretically premium passegers can afford all seats</p>
<h2 id="nested-policy-implementation">Nested policy implementation</h2>
<p><strong>Booking limits</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start</li>
<li>In class k a demand y<sub>k</sub> occurs.</li>
<li>The demand met min(y<sub>k</sub>, B<sub>k</sub>)</li>
<li>Subtract min(y<sub>k</sub>, B<sub>k</sub>) from all booking limits until they reach 0</li>
<li>End</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Protection limits</strong> an alternative approach

<strong>Littlewood's Rule: The probability that class 1 demand will be higher than the protection limit of booking class 1 should match the ratio of prices (r2/r1)</strong></p>
<h2 id="expected-marginal-seat-revenue-and-overbooking">Expected Marginal Seat Revenue and overbooking</h2>
<h3 id="booking-limits-for-more-than-2-classes">Booking limits for more than 2 classes</h3>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>K Booking Classes</li>
<li>Maximal Capacity C given</li>
<li>Classes are determined so that r1 &gt; r2 applies &gt; ... &gt; rK</li>
<li>Demand is met according to the sequential order of the booking classes</li>
<li>Nested protection limits</li>
<li>At each level, a two-class problem is solved</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution is to use heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EMSR-a</strong> Expected marginal seat revenue version a, uses aggregated protection limits</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/emsra.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="EMSR-a" /></p>

</ul>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/emsrb.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="EMSR-b" /></p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<ul>
<li>Both approaches are heuristics</li>
<li>EMSR-a aggregates the protection limits while EMSR-b aggregates the demand</li>
<li>Calculating the weighted average price is a critical assumption</li>
<li>In practice, EMSR-b is more widespread</li>
<li>Experimental studies show that neither method dominates the other</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overbooking">Overbooking</h1>
<p>From the capacity management strategies this topic touches the level capacity, where scarce or
expensive resources are maintained at a constant level, and the organisation must manage the consequential issues for customer satisfaction and operational service quality.</p>
<h2 id="example-lufthansa">Example Lufthansa</h2>
<p>Lufthansa has millions of no show passengers (8% of all bookings) this equals to tens of thounsands of empty flights per year. These are mostly busines travellers which book multiple flights.
Solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the cost of cancellations</li>
<li>Automatic cancellations for redundant flights</li>
<li>Flight reminders via SMS/e-mail</li>
<li>Advanced payments</li>
<li>Overbooking (most effective, sell more than avaiable seats because you accomodate for no shows)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-overbooking">Implementation overbooking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prognosis of no shows based on current bookings and time to flight (up to 16 model adjustments)</li>
<li>Exemplary prognosis features:
<ul>
<li>General: weekday, departure time, season, events</li>
<li>Passenger related: nationality, age etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps for handling overbooked flights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compensations (upgrades for later flights, money) for voluntary reschedulings</li>
<li>Terms and conditions for when more ppl show up than expected
<ul>
<li>Children and disabled passengers have priority</li>
<li>Premium customers are treated with priority</li>
<li>Forced rescheduling by check-in personnel</li>
<li>Compensation payments defined by regulations</li>
<li>Only necessary for 11 out of 10,000 passengers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-overbooking">Managing overbooking</h2>
<p>Overbooking is especially important if the number of no-shows is high and the cancellation does not entail any costs.</p>
<p>Overbooking is applied to
- Aircraft seats reserved prior to travel
- Car rental, where the cars are reserved before the day of rental
- Hotel rooms or concert tickets sold in advance
Procedure if customers have to be rejected:
- Hotels: alternative accommodation, compensation
- Car rental: Upgrade
- Airlines: alternative flights
- Advertising: alternative broadcasting times, discount
Minimize the number of no-shows
- require early payment
- increase cancellation fees
- increase rebooking fees</p>
<h3 id="assumptions-overbooking-model">Assumptions overbooking model</h3>
<p>C Capacity limitation
B Booking limit
r Price for one unit sold
p Penalties</p>
<p>Other assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each customer who appears pays r, despite potentially idle capacity</li>
<li>Number of no-shows is X</li>
<li>Density function of no shows is h(x) and distribution function of no-shows is H(x)</li>
<li>Density function of demand Y is f(y) and the distribution function F(y)</li>

<p>the play out strategy is user to obtain data from a predefined model (simulation, management games, model checking, workflow automation)</p>
<p>A <strong>reachability graph</strong> is a directed graph that can be obtained from a petri net and an initial marking.
All the markings are determined in a stepwise manners.
The reachability graph is obtained, where the markings(tokens) are represented by nodes and the transitions between a marking and its next marking is represented by a directed edge, annotated with the respective transition.

<li>identify unplanned deviations as well as requirements to modify production steps.</li>
<li>bottlenecks can be identified quickly</li>
<li>see which process changes really make sense, e.g., if a parallel queue of certain production steps can help to reduce throughput times

<p>Take the trace that happens most. Alone it lacks of fitness because it just represents one trace of them all.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong>: ability to play through the traces of a model</p>
<ul>
<li>perfect fitness if all traces in the log can be replayed by the model from beginning to end.
− Case level: fraction of traces in
the log that can be fully
replayed
− Event level: fraction of events in
the log that are indeed possible
according to the model</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/r2.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="log" /></p>
<p>Next step could be model all the traces. This lacks simplicity as it is overly complex and messy.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>:
− The simplest model that can explain the behavior seen in the log, is the best model.
− Complexity of the model could be defined by the number of nodes and arcs</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/r3.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="log" /></p>
<p>As a next step we could implement the traces as a flower model. This model lacks precision as it is underfitting because we could obtain traces that are not part of the original to be modeled traces. Flower model is too general.</p>
<p><strong>Precision</strong>:
− A model is precise if it does not allow for “too much” behavior
(“underfitting”).
− fraction of traces in the log to all traces that can be played out from the process model</p>
<p>--&gt; A high quaality model is defined through fitness, simplicity and precision.

--&gt; p and c always at least one since we cannot divide by zero</p>
<p>We can apply this formula on a higher level of the log level. We measure over all traces and sum up. We now consider the frequency of the traces. We measure the proportion of the events that can be replayed correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong> of token based replay fitness (problem of token flooding)</p>
<ul>
<li>Conformance values sometimes too optimistic due to &quot;token flooding“:</li>
<li>When the case differs much from the model, a lot of missing tokens are inserted during the replay.</li>
<li>As a result of all the added tokens, many transitions become enabled.</li>
<li>Therefore, also deviating events are likely to match an enabled transition.</li>
<li>This leads to misleading diagnostics because unwanted parts of the model may be activated.</li>
<li>So the fitness value for highly problematic executions may be too high.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong> of visible/uniquely labeled transitions. If a petrii net contains transitions with the same level, we do not have a definite way to replay and this approach to calculate conformance collapses.</p>

<h2 id="decision-point-mining-as-a-classification-problem">Decision point mining as a classification problem</h2>
<p>We will use the Gini impurity to build the decision tree.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Gini impurity is a way for a decision tree to measure how “mixed” the class labels are in a node. The probability that you would misclassify a randomly chosen sample from the node if you guessed the class at random according to the class distribution in that node.
More concretely:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a random sample from the node.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Predict” its class by randomly drawing a class label according to the node’s class proportions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gini impurity is the probability that this prediction is wrong.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Gini impurity → node is “purer” (mostly one class).</li>
<li>Higher Gini impurity → node is “mixed” (many classes with similar proportions).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/b12.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="log" /></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>How decision trees use Gini impurity</li>
</ol>
<p>In a classification tree (like CART), at each node the algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Considers possible splits (e.g., “feature X ≤ 3.5?”).</li>
<li>For each split, it computes the weighted average Gini impurity of the child nodes</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/b13.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="log" />
3. Chooses the split that reduces Gini impurity the most (i.e., maximizes impurity decrease).</p>
<p>So Gini impurity is the criterion the tree uses to decide where to split so that nodes become purer and purer.

<h1 id="customer-lifetime-value">Customer Lifetime Value</h1>
<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li>total financial contribution from the current period into the future of a customer over his/her future lifetime with the company – that is, revenues minus costs<br />
− reflects the future profitability of the customer
− present value of the cumulative cash flows of a customer
− Comparable to net present value of machines</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>− helps a firm to know how much it can invest in retaining the customer as to achieve a positive return on investment
− focus investments on customers that bring the maximum profit
− deciding on customer-specific communication strategies</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/lilli/Documents/Zhaw/25HS/DataServicesProducts/Images/clv1.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="log" /></p>
<p>Definition Contribution Margin: The rest of the revenue that remains after paying all the variable const of the revenue. Can be used to pay it towards fix costs
During the customer aquisition the revenue is quite low, therefore the contrivution margin is negative because the variable costs to aquire the customer are higher than the revenue. When the trust with the customer is built ans the customer is retained,the customer will spend more resulting in high revenue and higher/positive contribution margin. If the customer leaves (better offers somewhere else) the company has to spend money to recover the customer therefore revenue and contribution margin sink again.</p>

<p>Example:
Consider a CLV model with the following variables. What is the acquisition cost threshold, from which on a customer relationship becomes unprofitable?
• Fixed revenues per period: CHF 5
• Fixed cost per period: CHF 3
• Customer retention rate: 0.65
• Interest rate per period: 0.05</p>
<p>m = 5 - 3 = 2</p>
<p>m * r / (1+i-r) = 2 * 0.65 / (1 + 0.05 - 0.65) = 3.25</p>

<p>Fixed retention rates is not realisitc as it is very subjective to different customer groups or business settings because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recency effect (intuition here: the more recent the last
transaction, the higher the transaction probability/retention
rate)</li>
<li>Frequency effect (intuition here: budgetary constrains and
worn out novelty effect reduce transaction probability/retention
rate)</li>
